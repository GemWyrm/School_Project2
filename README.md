# School_Project2
by Jared Clyde.
Project displaying API proficiency.
Site allowing for searching of GIPHY images.
Using HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript.
Future improvements:
    1. Save GIFs to Favorites.
    2. Responsively adjust row-gap height to be the same as justify-content: space-between.
    3. Responsively adjust header logo to be the same height as surrounding text.
    4. Add additional screen size breakpoints.
To use, download all files except *.scss and *.css.map (these are uploaded for evaluation purposes only) and acquire your own API key from GIPHY, then put the API key in main.js wherever is says 'API_KEY' (capitalized only). Then launch index.html with localhost.
